# Footprint-Power-Generation
The Design and develop the system that generates electrical energy from human foot steps using a mechanical  rack-and pinion mechanism connected to a DC generator. The project aims to convert the kinetic energy  produced by walking into usable electrical energy without relying on piezoelectric materials, making it more  affordable and accessible.
